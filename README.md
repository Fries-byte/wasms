# wasms
web assembly simply. wasms is a wasm inspired compiler that'll make you able to make it easier to use wasm like system to run C, C++, Python and Rust (still in dev), or use an wat like code to program in it. Its also supported on website since it's compiler is written in JavaScript

## Getting started

you'll be needing Node.js <br>
at first, clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fries-byte/wasms
```

to start, make a file with the .wst (or web assembly (s) text) extention (fx. app.wst) and program in it (Course will probably not be made) <br>
after you're done, use

```bash
node int.js filename.app
```

after that, create a .html file and use the <script> tag and put the interpreter, and you're done!
